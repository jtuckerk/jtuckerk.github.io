                In this post I will explain what a loss landscape is and how it relates to training
                a model to make predictions. Creating these visualizations after
                reading <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.09913">Visualizing the loss landscape of
                neural networks</a> helped me understand that paper and appreciate the complexity of
                training neural networks. Hopefully this post will give you some useful intuitions
                about machine learning and allow you to thoroughly
                enjoy <a href="https://losslandscape.com">Javier Ideami's nice loss landscape
                images</a>.

                we saw how models make predictions, but skipped over how they are trained to make
                predictions. If you haven't read that post yet, I recommend that you do. This post
                will make use of the same models and datasets.

              <h3> What is Loss? </h3>
              <p class="para">
                When a model makes predictions, we need some way to quantify how good those
                predictions are.
              </p>
              <p class="para">
                <b>What's wrong with accuracy?</b> It's a common and familiar metric. If a model
                makes 10 predictions and got 9 of them correct, that would be an accuracy of
                90%. But what if the desired predictions are either 0 or 1 (with a decision boundary
                of 0.5)? For a desired value of 1, one model might predict 0.6 and another might be
                0.99. Both models would be correct (above 0.5) for that example, but in order to
                train, there needs to be some way to say that the latter makes a better prediction.
              </p>

              <p class="para">
                We need a <b>loss function</b> that will measure how close the desired output $y$
                and the model output $\hat y$ are to each other. As the model output gets closer to
                the desired output, the loss should decrease and reach 0 when the values match. The
                process of changing a model to minimize the loss is
                called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization">optimization</a>. In
                machine learning this is typically done with some variant
                of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_gradient_descent">stochastic
                  gradient descent</a> (SGD) and won't be the focus of this post.

              Figure 2 shows how the loss changes as the predictions get further away from the
              desired outputs. For example, if the desired output was 0 and the prediction was 2,
              that would result in a loss value of 4. The average of the loss for each point point
              in the dataset gives the loss for the whole dataset. For this post the
              loss values used to construct the landscapes will be the average loss for the whole
              dataset.

            <p class="para">
              In <a href="visualize_nn_predictions.html" target="_blank">post 1</a> we looked at the inputs as
              points. We also saw notation for a model as a function that took in points and
              parameters (values for weights and biases) to produce predictions: $\textbf{P} =
              f(\textbf{D}, \theta)$. Let's conceptualize the parameters Î¸ as a
              point in $n$ dimensional space, where $n$ is the number of parameters in the model.

              landscape than it started. Figures 4, 5, and 6 all show the same data in slightly
              different ways.

            <p class="para">
              <b>Why train? Can't we pick the point with the lowest loss in the landscape?</b>
              Calculating the loss for each point in figure 4 isn't free. For this model
              and dataset, it takes slightly more time than optimizing with SGD. As models get
              larger, searching for an optima in this way quickly becomes intractable.
            </p>
            <p class="para">
              <b>How do we visualize larger models?</b> Model 2 from visualizing NN predictions had
              an additional parameter $b$, so if we wanted to plot all of the parameters and the
              loss, $(q, s, b, \mathcal{L})$ we would need 4 dimensions. But model 3 has 13
              parameters, and models used on <i>real problems</i> can have thousands
              to <a href="https://yashuseth.blog/2019/06/12/bert-explained-faqs-understand-bert-working/">hundreds
                of millions of parameters</a>. Since we can't visualize every dimension of those loss
              landscapes, we'll need a way to visualize sections of the landscape that might be
              interesting.
            </p>
            <h3> Slicing the loss landscape </h3>
            <p class="para">
              In this post we'll see 1D, 2D, and 3D slices of loss landscapes. We've seen models as
              2D points in figures 3 through 6, which can be considered 2D slices. To understand
              that, let's look at a 1D slice of that model's landscape for the Diagonal dataset.
            </p>

            </div>
            <p class="para">
              In order to calculate the parameter values Î¸ for each point along a slice, we'll
              take a weighted average (linear interpolation) of the parameters for model A, $Î¸_A$,
              and Model B, $Î¸_B$.
            </p>

              \rightarrow \theta = Î¸_B$</div>

            <p class="para">
              In figure 7, the points along the curved arc show the parameters of the model as the
              optimizer updates them in order to minimize the loss. The pink dot traces the line
              shown in figure 8. We could have chosen any slice, but if we're interested in the
              model's behavior while training, a slice showing the start and end point seems
              useful.
            </p>
            <h3> Visualizing More Complex Landscapes </h3>
            <p class="para">
              We've seen how to take a 1D slice of a 2D parameter space. Now we'll look at 2D and
              3D slices of 13 dimensional parameter spaces for <a href="visualize_nn_predictions.html#Model3" target="_blank">Model 3</a>, a 2 layer neural network.
            </p>
            <p class="para">
              To make a 2D slice, we'll need 2 directions in space to define the slice. If we chose
              a slice parallel to the first slice, the resulting landscape would be misleadingly
              symmetrical and unintuitive, since we will visualize each slice on perpendicular axes.

              Having slices perpendicular to each other will allow us to visualize more interesting
              features of the loss landscape. For the figures below I've
              used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis">principal
                component analysis (PCA)</a> to pick good slices. The result of PCA over the set of
              parameters at each training step gives vectors (directions in space) that indicate the
              major movements of the model during training. Figure 10 shows slices chosen with the
              help of PCA.

              In figure 12 we see 2 low points, the lowest is where the model ended up after
              training. The other appears to be what is referred to as
              a <a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/functions-maxima-minima.html">local
              minimum</a>, a point where any slight change in the model results in a higher
              loss. This point turns out to not actually be a local minimum. It just so happens that
              this slice misses points near there that would have a lower loss. This can be
              confirmed by starting the model at that point and verifying that training results in
              an even lower loss. The animations below show how some apparent local minima get lower
              as the 2D slice moves.

              The takeaway from figure 13 and 14 is that 2D slices of loss landscapes may be
              misleading. By extension, we should assume that 3D slices for models with 13 parameters
              or more are probably not perfect representations of the model's whole landscape.

              <b>So why do we care?</b> Most applications of machine learning use loss minimization
              as the primary objective of training and a large portion of research on ML can be seen
              as finding algorithms that are better at navigating loss landscapes or finding models
              with loss landscapes that are easier to
              navigate. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.09913">Visualizing the loss landscape of
              neural networks</a> showed that adding <a href="">skip connections</a> can make the
              loss landscape smoother, and therefore easier to
              navigate. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04836">On Large-Batch Training for Deep
              Learning: Generalization Gap and Sharp Minima</a> showed that training with smaller
              batches of data results in the models ending up in low points where the
              surrounding <i>bowl</i> is much wider, which correlates with a model performing well
              on unseen data. These aren't proofs of why these tools and procedures result in better
              models, but they are useful relationships to understand.

            <h3> In summary </h3>
            <p class="para">
              <ul>
                <li>We defined loss as the result of a loss function on a model's output and the
                  desired output.</li>
                <li>We looked at model parameters as points.</li>
                <li>We created loss landscapes by
                  including the loss value for each point in the parameter space.</li>
                <li> Lastly, we created low
                  dimensional slices to visualize landscapes for complex models.

            <h3> Beyond Loss </h3>
            <p class="para">
              Understanding and manipulating the loss landscape is not everything in ML. Another
              major area of research is understanding if the data and loss functions appropriately
              represent a useful objective. Meaning, does a model with 0 loss get 100% accuracy?
              More importantly, how does such a model handle new data, and does it generate outputs
              that are useful, fair, and safe?
