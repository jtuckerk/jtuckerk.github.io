              <p class="para">
                In this post we'll explore what happens within a neural network when it makes a
                prediction. A neural network is a function that takes some input and produces an
                output according to some desired prediction. It's possible to make
                state-of-the-art predictions without understanding the concepts highlighted in this
                post. That's part of the beauty of modern computing and aggregate knowledge in
                general. But some things are too fundamental to just accept as fact and when I
                really stopped to look at these functions, machine learning became a little bit less
                of black box.</p>
              <p class="para">
                The models (not all are neural networks) in this post are composed of 3
                types of operations.
              </p>

              <ul class="">
                <li>Matrix Multiplication</li>
                <li>Bias (Addition)</li>
                <li>Non-Linear Functions</li>
              </ul>

              <p class="para"> We'll build 3 models, add 1 operation at a time, and visualize why it
                is necessary to make a prediction. If you're comfortable in Python, you can follow
                along
                in <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1LsJFYZvSg8rKqzZyoUYKIgbhiUZLKK02#offline=true&sandboxMode=true">code</a>. Let's
                start by defining the structure of the inputs and outputs.
              </p>

              <h3> Datasets </h3>
              <p class="para">
                We'll look at 3 datasets in this
                post. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set">The Iris Flower
                Dataset</a> and 2 synthetic datasets. We won't actually make predictions on the Iris
                dataset, but it will help us understand the structure of the other 2 datasets, which
                are a bit more abstract. The Iris dataset consists of information about 3 species of
                flowers: 4 measurements, petal width, petal length, sepal width, and sepal length
                (in centimeters) and a species label for each flower. A common task is to predict
                the species from the measurements. The model takes 4 input measurements,
                or <b>features</b>, as a point $(pw, pl, sw, sl)$ and predicts a score for each
                species $(s0, s1, s2)$. A high score $s2$ and lower scores $s0$ and $s1$ means the
                model predicts that the input measurements came from a flower of species 2,
                Virginica.
              </p>
              <p class="para">
                Instead of predicting scores for 3 species, we might only want to predict if
                measurements came from species 2 or not. In this case we could make the model output
                scores (<b>s2</b>, <b>not s2</b>). Or even simpler, we could use a single
                score <b>s2</b> and interpret high scores to mean the model predicts the
                measurements came from species 2 and low scores to mean they did not. We can choose
                a threshold, or decision boundary, to determine what is low and what is high. 0.5 is
                a common decision boundary.
              </p>
              <p class="para">
                We can think of the 4 input measurements as points in 4 dimensional space and the
                predictions for all 3 species as points in 3D space, but as people living in 3D and
                looking at this post on 2D screens, that is easier said than done. The datasets
                we'll predict in this post have just 2 input features and a single output dimension,
                2D points and 1D points, respectively.
              </p>

                  <div class="figure-text-center"><b>Dataset 1.)</b> Diagonal dataset</div>
                  <p class="para">
                    The first synthetic dataset is the Diagonal dataset. A 2D point in the X-Y
                    plane, e.g. $(0.6, 0.2)$ is a single input to the model and its color is the
                    thing the model is trying to predict.
                  </p>
                </div>

                <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
                  <a name="XOR_Dataset">
                  <img src="images/xor_dataset.png" class="img-fluid mx-auto">

                  <div class="figure-text-center"><b>Dataset 2.)</b> XOR dataset</div>
                  <p class="para">
                    The second is
                    the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or#Computer_science">XOR</a>
                    dataset. Remember, the model is not predicting something about an image full of
                    colored points, it's just predicting the color of each point.
                  </p>
                  </a>
                </div>
              </div>
              <p class="para">
                When the model takes in a point $(x, y)$, it should output a prediction as a single
                number, $p$. This is analogous to predicting a single species in the Iris
                dataset, low for <b>not blue</b> and high for <b>blue</b>. <br> Let's try to get a
                visual understanding of how our 3 operations can turn input points into
                predictions.
              </p>

              <h3> Matrix multiplication </h3>
              <p class="para">
                There are a lot of ways to think about matrix multiplication, but for now let's
                think about it as applying some change $\textbf{W}$ to a set of points
                $\textbf{D}$. We'll call this a projection $\textbf{P}$.
              </p>

              <p class="para">
                It's important to note that the size of $\textbf{P}$ is determined by the first axis
                of $\textbf{D}$ and the second axis of $\textbf{W}$ i.e. the same number of points
                come out as went in, but the dimensionality of the points is determined by the
                weight matrix $\textbf{W}$'s 2nd axis. The <i>middle</i> axes, $2$ in this example,
                must be the same size for a matrix multiplication to make sense.<br> Let's look at
                an example where we project the input points into 2 dimensions and 1 dimension. The
                weights of matrix $\textbf{W}$: $\textbf{q}$, $\textbf{r}$, $\textbf{s}$, and
                $\textbf{t}$ determine where in space these points get projected.

                different weight values for both the 2D and 1D projection. It's useful to think
                about the space and the points within it being stretched and rotated by a
                projection. This is easiest to see in the first plot in 2D. The values $\textbf{q}$
                and $\textbf{s}$ are in both weight matrices and the 1D projection is just
                the <b>x'</b> values from the result of the 2D projection. At this point you may

              diagonal), and should be mapped to above 0.5 in the prediction. The model could really
              stretch the output space to make the right prediction, but let's go ahead and
              introduce another operation to make this dataset a bit simpler to solve.

            <div class="figure-text-center"><b>Dataset 2.)</b> XOR dataset</div>
            <p class="para">
              You may be wondering how matrix multiplication and a bias can be used to project and
              shift the XOR dataset such that the appropriate points lie on the appropriate side of
              the 0.5 decision boundary. The simple answer is that given only those two operations,
              it's not possible. The result of series of matrix multiplications and bias
              shifts, <b>linear transformations</b> , can always be simplified down to a single
              linear transformation. In the example below we project <b>a</b> to <b>b</b>
              then <b>b</b> to <b>c</b> and so on to <b>e</b>, but there will always be a projection
              that will allow us to project <b>a</b> directly to <b>e</b> and a single linear
              transformation can only rotate, stretch, and shift. This will always be the case for
              any sequence of linear transformations, even when projecting up into 3 or more
              dimensions and then back down.

            <p class="para">
              So the model needs a <b>non-linear</b> function that can <b>fold</b> the space the
              points are in so that a single rotation and shift can put all of the points of the
              appropriate color on the appropriate side of the 0.5 decision boundary.

            <img src="visualize_nn_predictions/images/sigmoid.png" class="img-fluid mx-auto">

            <p class="para">
              Here we have the sigmoid function: a <b>non-linear function</b>. The next model starts
              by up projecting the dataset into 3 dimensions. When the points are in 3 dimensions,
              they can be folded in some interesting ways with the sigmoid function. We'll denote
              the result of these operations as <b>H</b>, since usually intermediate layers in a
              neural network are referred to as hidden. (Don't worry though, we'll take a peek at
              what this layer looks like). Now that we've given the model the ability to fold, it
              can project those points down to a set of 1D predictions that wasn't possible before.
